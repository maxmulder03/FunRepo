## Welcome
If you find joy in the simple things like using a tool that you created, learning a new shortcut, or just discovering anything else that makes the way you interact with your computer more efficient or enjoyable then you're like me. While projects like [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git) or [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl.git) didn't make me an awesome programmer, they sparked an odd fascination early on that influenced the way I see and appreciate software. With that said, if you happen to be reading this then I hope you find something that interests you.

<b>Also...</b> please feel free to offer any suggetions or mock me for being amazed by things like being able to use <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> instead of holding down the left/right arrow keys to navigate in the command line.

## Command Line Shortcuts
###### _This is obviously not a comprehensive keyboard shortcut doc. This section is meant to highlight my favorite shortcuts & shortcut combinations that I use everyday and think aren't obviously beneficial after a quick glance at some documentation._

| Shortcuts |
| ------------- |
|<br> <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> + <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>K</kbd> : <b>Erase an entire line in the terminal.</b> <br><br>|
|<br> <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> : <b>This shortcut searches your command history to match the characters you type after the command.</b> <br><br>_Usage: Press <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>R</kbd>, start typing a command, press <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> again to start scrolling through previous commands that partially match what you've typed or simply press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> if the first command that comes up is the one you want._ <br><br>|
|<br> <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>X</kbd> + <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> : <b>Opens a text editor to easily type longer terminal commands.</b><br><br>_Usage: After you save & close the text editor file, the command will appear in the terminal & you can simply press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to run the command._<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> _In my opinon, this isn't wildly helpful with the default text editor but check out the **[Shell Essentials](#shell-essentials)** section of this README to see how to make this shortcut much better by having it open VSCode instead._ <br><br>|
